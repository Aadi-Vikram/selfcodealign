[Property]
category: function implementation
language: Python
concepts: 5-bit chunk encoding with bitwise shifts, ASCII value manipulation, continuation bit signaling

[Instruction]
Create a Python function to encode an integer into a sequence of encoded characters, where each character represents a 5-bit chunk of the integer. The ASCII value of each chunk character is formed by adding 63 to the 5-bit chunk's value. For all chunks except the last one, set the 6th bit to 1 to indicate continuation. Employ bitwise operations for this encoding process.

[Response]
[Reasoning]
To encode an integer into a sequence of encoded characters based on the specified criteria, let's follow these steps:

1. Break down the integer into 5-bit chunks: Extract 5-bit chunks from the integer using using `& 31` (`0x1F`), because the binary representation of `31` (`11111`) has the last five bits set, which will effectively extract the 5 bits we are interested in. We start from the least significant bits (LSB).
2. Set continuation bit: For all chunks except the last one, set the 6th bit to 1 using `| 32` (`0x20`) because the binary representation of `32` (`100000`) has the 6th bit set to 1. This indicates that there's another continuation chunk following.
3. Shift right: Right-shift the value by 5 to process the next 5 bits.
4. Convert to characters: Use `ord` and `chr` to convert each chunk (now effectively 6 bits due to the continuation bit) into a character by adding 63 to its value. This ensures that the character is within a printable ASCII range.
5. Assembly: Assemble these characters into the final encoded string while maintaining the order of the chunks through `reversed`.

[Implementation]
Here's how you can implement this function:

```python
def encode_integer_to_chars(value: int) -> str:
    # Base case for 0
    if value == 0:
        return chr(63)

    encoded_chars = []
    while value > 0:
        # Extract the 5-bit chunk and add 63 to its value
        chunk = (value & 31) + 63
        value >>= 5
        # If there's still more of the value left, set the continuation bit
        if value > 0:
            chunk |= 32
        encoded_chars.append(chr(chunk))

    # Reverse the list of characters to start with the least significant chunk
    # and join them into a single string
    return ''.join(reversed(encoded_chars))
```

[Explanation]
This function processes the integer bit by bit in 5-bit chunks, applying bitwise operations to extract and manipulate these chunks, then converts each chunk into a character using the specified encoding scheme. This approach efficiently handles the encoding in a loop until all bits of the integer have been processed.

Note that this function is designed for non-negative integers and does not support negative integers by default because negative numbers are represented in two's complement form, where the most significant bit (MSB) indicates the sign. In Python, right-shifting (`>>`) a negative integer preserves the sign bit, effectively making the never executed due to the `value > 0` condition. If you change it to `value != 0`, it will then lead to an infinite loop if the same encoding logic is applied to negative integers without modifications.

[Tests]
You can validate this function with a few test cases to ensure correctness:

```python
assert encode_integer_to_chars(0) == chr(63)
assert encode_integer_to_chars(1) == chr(63 + 1)
assert encode_integer_to_chars(31) == chr(63 + 31)
assert encode_integer_to_chars(int(0b1)) == chr(0b1 + 63)
assert encode_integer_to_chars(int(0b1000001)) == chr(0b10 + 63) + chr(63 + 0b100001)
```

These tests cover scenarios from zero to a number requiring more than one chunk, ensuring the function operates as expected.

### Example 2
[Code]
def ceil_shift(n, b):
    """Return ceil(n / 2**b) without performing any floating-point or division operations.
    This is done by right-shifting n by b bits and incrementing the result by 1

    """
    if not isinstance(n, int) or not isinstance(b, int):
        raise TypeError("unsupported operand type(s): %r and %r" % (type(n).__name__, type(b).__name__))
    assert n >= 0 and b >= 0    # I haven't tested or even thought about negative values
    mask = (1 << b) - 1
    if n & mask:
        return (n >> b) + 1
    else:

category: function implementation
language: Python
concepts: bitwise operation for division, ceiling without division or float, input validation with assertions, non-negative integer checks

[Instruction]
Develop a Python function `ceil_divide_without_div` that computes the ceiling of `n / 2**b` without using division, floating-point operations, built-in functions like `math.ceil`, or converting it into computing the floor. Instead, use bit manipulation to achieve the result. You write assertions to ensure both `n` and `b` are non-negative integers.

[Response]
[Reasoning]
We can leverage the properties of bitwise operations to develop a Python function that computes the ceiling of `n / 2**b` without using division, floating-point operations, or any built-in functions like `math.ceil`, and strictly avoiding converting the problem into a floor computation.

In the context, dividing by `2**b` is equivalent to right-shifting `n` by `b` bits in binary representation when `n` is divisible by `2**b`. Otherwise, this approach inherently computes the floor of the division. To adjust for the ceiling without directly calculating it, we can consider two cases:

1. If `n` is divisible by `2**b`, the result of the division is simply the value of right-shifting `n` by `b` bits.
2. Otherwise, we need to increment the right-shifted result by 1 to achieve the ceiling effect.

To determine the divisibility of `n` by `2**b`, we can check if the first `b` bits of `n` are all 0. This can be done using a mask with the first `b` bits set to 1, and then performing a bitwise AND operation with `n`. If the result is 0, it indicates that `n` is divisible by `2**b`. The mask can be created using `mask = (1 << b) - 1`.

We'll also include assertions to ensure that `n` and `b` are non-negative integers.

[Implementation]
Here is the implementation of `ceil_divide_without_div`:

```python
def ceil_divide_without_div(n: int, b: int) -> int:
    assert isinstance(n, int) and n >= 0, "n must be a non-negative integer"
    assert isinstance(b, int) and b >= 0, "b must be a non-negative integer"

    # Constructing the mask to check divisibility
    mask = (1 << b) - 1
    divisible = (n & mask) == 0

    result = n >> b

    # If n is not divisible by 2**b, increment the result to get the ceiling
    if not divisible:
        result += 1

    return result
```

[Explanation]
This function calculates the ceiling of `n / 2**b` purely through bitwise manipulation and integer arithmetic. The assertions ensure the input constraints are met, as specified.

[Tests]
To verify the correctness of the function, we can run the following tests:

```python
import math

assert ceil_divide_without_div(10, 3) == math.ceil(10 / 2**3)
assert ceil_divide_without_div(17, 4) == math.ceil(17 / 2**4)
assert ceil_divide_without_div(100, 5) == math.ceil(100 / 2**5)
assert ceil_divide_without_div(0, 3) == math.ceil(0 / 2**3)
assert ceil_divide_without_div(1, 0) == math.ceil(1 / 2**0)
```

These tests compare the results of our function with the expected results obtained using `math.ceil` to ensure the correctness of the ceiling division operation.

### Example 3
[Code]
    isprime = n >= 2 and 1 or 0
    for prime in prime_list:                    # Check for factors with all primes
        if prime * prime > n: break             # ... up to sqrt(n)
        if not n % prime:
            isprime = 0
            break
    if isprime: prime_dict[n] = 1               # Maintain a dictionary for fast lookup
    return isprime
def prime(x):
    ''' Returns the xth prime '''
    lastn = prime_list[-1]
    while len(prime_list) <= x:                 # Keep working until we've got the xth prime
        lastn = lastn + 1                       # Check the next number

[Property]
category: class implementation
language: Python
concepts: prime number memoization, n-th prime calculation, efficiency in prime checks

[Instruction]
Implement a Python class with a method `find_nth_prime_memoized(n)` that returns the nth prime number, where n is a positive integer. Utilize memoization to store already found prime numbers in a list within the class to avoid recalculating primes for multiple method calls. Ensure the method efficiently updates and references this list to find new primes as needed. Additionally, enhance performance by avoiding unnecessary prime checks.

[Response]
[Reasoning]
Implementing the required Python class with the method `find_nth_prime_memoized(n)` involves several key steps:

1. The class should have a constructor `__init__` that initializes the cache list to store the memoized prime numbers. Initially, the list can be seeded with the first two prime numbers, 2 and 3.
2. The method `find_nth_prime_memoized` will check if the requested `n`th prime is already in the memoized list. If it is, it will return that prime directly. If not, it will start from the last cached prime and continue to find and cache new primes until the `n`th prime is found.
3. A helper method `is_prime` can be defined to check if a number is prime. To efficiently check for primality:
    - It checks if the number is divisible by each of the primes already in the cache.
    - It only checks up to the square root of the number to be tested, implemented by comparing the square of the prime with the number.
    - It skips even numbers by incrementing by 2 for each prime check. This is sound since the cache is initialized with the first **two** primes, 2 and 3.

[Implementation]
Here is how you could implement such a class:

```python
class PrimeFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.primes = [2, 3]

    def is_prime(self, num: int) -> bool:
        if num < 2:
            return False
        for prime in self.primes:
            if prime * prime > num:
                break
            if num % prime == 0:
                return False
        return True

    def find_nth_prime_memoized(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Return the n-th prime directly if already in cache
        if n <= len(self.primes):
            return self.primes[n - 1]

        # Start checking from the number after the last prime in cache
        current_num = self.primes[-1] + 2
        while len(self.primes) < n:
            if self.is_prime(current_num):
                # Cache the new prime
                self.primes.append(current_num)
            # Skip even numbers
            current_num += 2

        return self.primes[n - 1]
```

[Explanation]
This class `PrimeFinder` initializes with a cache of the first two primes. The `is_prime` method checks if a number is prime by dividing it with cached primes up to its square root. The `find_nth_prime_memoized` method uses this helper method to find and cache primes up to the requested `n`th one. Subsequent calls leverage cached primes for efficiency.

[Tests]
Here's how you can test this class:

```python
# Test that the class correctly finds the first few primes
first_few_primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
prime_finder = PrimeFinder()
for i, prime in enumerate(first_few_primes, 1):
    assert prime_finder.find_nth_prime_memoized(i) == prime

# Test that the memoized results are returned directly
for i, prime in enumerate(first_few_primes, 1):
    assert prime_finder.find_nth_prime_memoized(i) == prime
```

These tests verify that the class correctly finds the first few primes and that subsequent calls return the memoized results directly.

### Example 4

        return ((k + 1) ** 2) / 2 + k + 1
    else:
        return (k ** 2) / 2 + 2 * k + 1
def multiset_powerset(multiset):
    n = len(multiset)

        while i >= 0 and not changed:

category: function implementation

concepts: special formula implementation, odd and even number handling, function composition

[Instruction]
Here are two special formulas:

$$
f_1(a, b) = (a + 1) \cdot (b + 1) - 1
$$

$$
f_2(k) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{(k + 1)^2}{2} + k + 1 & \text{if } k \text{ is odd} \\
    \frac{k^2}{2} + 2k + 1 & \text{if } k \text{ is even}
\end{cases}
$$

Write a Python function to return $f_2(f_1(a, b))$ for given `a` and `b`.

[Response]
[Reasoning]
Based on the formulas you provided, we can define two Python functions, `f1(a, b)` and `f2(k)`, respectively, and then combine them to calculate $f2(f1(a, b))$ for given `a` and `b`.

[Implementation]
Here is the implementation:

```python
def f1(a, b):
    return (a + 1) * (b + 1) - 1

def f2(k):
    if k % 2 == 0:  # Check if k is even
        return (k**2) / 2 + 2 * k + 1
    else:  # k is odd
        return ((k + 1)**2) / 2 + k + 1

def f1_f2_combined(a, b):
    return f2(f1(a, b))
```

[Explanation]
In this implementation:
- `f1(a, b)` calculates the first formula you've given.
- `f2(k)` calculates the second formula, with a conditional branch for whether `k` is even or odd.
- `f1_f2_combined(a, b)` uses the output of `f1(a, b)` as the input for `f2(k)` and returns the result.

[Tests]
To test this combined function, you can simply compare it with the direct application of `f2` to the result of `f1` for different values of `a` and `b`:

```python
assert f1_f2_combined(2, 3) == f2(f1(2, 3))
assert f1_f2_combined(4, 5) == f2(f1(4, 5))
assert f1_f2_combined(6, 7) == f2(f1(6, 7))
```

### Example 5
[Code]
    while left<len(arr) and ryt >= start and left <= ryt:
        mid = (left+ryt)//2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            ryt = mid-1
        else:
            left = mid+1
    return left

[Property]
category: function implementation
language: Python
concepts: insertion point for a sorted array, optimized time complexity

[Instruction]
Design a Python function that takes a sorted array and a target value, and return a valid index where target can be inserted to maintain the array's sorted order. Optimize the function to run in logarithmic time complexity.

For example, given `array = [1, 3, 5, 5, 6]` and `target = 5`, the function should return either 2 or 3 because 5 presents at both indices 2 and 3.

[Response]
[Reasoning]
To solve this problem efficiently and ensure logarithmic time complexity, we can use a binary search algorithm. Compared with a standard binary search that looks for an exact match, we can modify the algorithm such that when the target is not found, we return the `left` bound, which represents the index where the target can be inserted to maintain the array's sorted order. Since any valid index for insertion is acceptable, we can direclty return the index if there is an exact match.

[Implementation]
Here is a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
from typing import List

def search_insert_position(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    """
    Finds the index to insert `target` into `nums` to maintain sorted order. For example,
    given `nums = [1, 3, 5, 5, 6]` and `target = 5`, this function returns either 2 or 3,
    as `target` can be inserted at index 2 or 3 to maintain the sorted order.
    """
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        # Directly return the index if there's an exact match
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    # At this point, `left` is the correct insertion index
    return left
```

[Explanation]
This implementation ensures that when `target` is not found, `left` represents the correct insertion index. This is because at the end of the loop, all elements to the left of `left` are smaller than `target`, all elements to the right of `left` are equal to or larger than `target`, and `left > right`. Therefore, `left` is the correct index for insertion to maintain the sorted order.

[Tests]
To test this function, you can use the example you provided:

```python
# Provided example
assert search_insert_position([1, 3, 5, 5, 6], 5) in [2, 3]
# Additional cases
assert search_insert_position([1, 3, 5, 5, 6], 2) == 1
assert search_insert_position([1, 3, 5, 5, 6], 7) == 5
```

These tests cover the scenario where the target is found at multiple indices, as well as cases where the target is not present in the array but needs to be inserted at the correct position to maintain the sorted order.

    source = self.compressed

    res = bytearray()

    while pos < len(source):
        code = int(source[pos])
        child = node.children[code]
        if child.is_leaf:
            res.append(child)
            node = self.root
        else:
            node = child

    return bytes(res)

[Property]
category: class and function implementation
language: Python
concepts: decoding Huffman compressed data, binary tree traversal, byte array processing

[Instruction]
Write a Python function `huffman_decompress` that takes two arguments: `compressed_data`, a byte array of 0/1 sequence representing Huffman compressed data, and `huffman_tree`, a Huffman tree that stores the actual data (each leaf is associated with a character). The function should return the original uncompressed data as `bytes`. Define the `HuffmanNode` class yourself as a general tree structure with a `children` list.

[Response]
[Reasoning]
To accomplish the Huffman decompression, we first need to define the `HuffmanNode` class, which, as required, should be a general tree structure with a `children` list and an optional `value` attribute to store the character associated with a leaf node.

Then, we'll implement the `huffman_decompress` function. This function will traverse the Huffman tree according to the bits in `compressed_data`. When it encounters a leaf node, the associated character will be appended to the result, and the traversal restarts from the root of the tree. This process continues until the entire `compressed_data` is processed.

You said that `compressed_data` is a byte array of 0/1 sequence, so I assume that each byte, not each bit, represents a step in the Huffman tree. In practice, it is more efficient

[Implementation]
Here's how we can implement this:

```python
class HuffmanNode:
    def __init__(self, value=None):
        self.value = value
        self.children = []

def huffman_decompress(compressed_data, huffman_tree):
    # Store the decompressed characters here
    result = []

    # Start traversal from the root of the Huffman tree
    node = huffman_tree

    # Each byte represents a 0/1 bit in `compressed_data`
    for bit in compressed_data:
        # Check if the node has children
        if len(node.children) > 0:
            node = node.children[int(bit)]
        # After moving to the child, check if it's a leaf node
        if len(node.children) == 0:
            result.append(node.value)
            # Reset to start from the root for the next character
            node = huffman_tree

    # Convert the result to bytes
    return "".join(result).encode()
```

[Explanation]
In this implementation, we assume that `compressed_data` is a byte array where each byte represents a 0/1 bit in the Huffman tree. We traverse the tree according to the bits in `compressed_data`, and when we reach a leaf node, we append the associated character to the result. Finally, we convert the result to `bytes` by concatenating the characters and encoding them.

[Tests]
You can test this function with a sample Huffman tree and compressed data to verify that the decompression works correctly:

```python
root = HuffmanNode()
root.children = [HuffmanNode('A'), HuffmanNode('B')]
root.children[0].children = [HuffmanNode('C'), HuffmanNode('D')]
root.children[1].children = [HuffmanNode('E'), HuffmanNode('F')]
compressed_data = bytearray([0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1])
# 01 -> D, 00 -> C, 11 -> F
assert huffman_decompress(compressed_data, root) == b'DCF'
```

[Instruction]
Create a Python function to format a file size in bytes into a human-readable string representation, using 'bytes', 'KB' (kilobytes), 'MB' (megabytes), 'GB' (gigabytes), or 'TB' (terabytes) units. The output should be rounded to one decimal place and follow the format: "{X.Y}{Unit}", where "Unit" is the appropriate size unit and "X.Y" is the rounded size. For example, `format_size(1024 * 512)` should return `'512.0KB'`, and `format_size(1024**2 - 1)` should return `'1024.0KB'`.

[Response]
[Reasoning]
To create such a function, we can use a loop to iterate through a predefined list of units (`['bytes', 'KB', 'MB', 'GB', 'TB']`) and check if the given number of bytes fits into the current unit by comparing it with 1024.0 and -1024.0 (for handling negative sizes). We'll keep dividing the number by 1024.0 until the correct unit is found where the number is less than 1024.0. Then, we'll format the result using the appropriate unit and the rounded size.

[Implementation]
```python
def format_size(size_bytes):
    units = ['bytes', 'KB', 'MB', 'GB', 'TB']
    if size_bytes == 0:
        return "0.0bytes"  # Directly return for 0 bytes to avoid division by zero in loop
    num = abs(size_bytes)
    unit = units[0]

    for u in units[1:]:
        if num < 1024.0:
            break
        num /= 1024.0
        unit = u

    formatted_size = f"{num:.1f}{unit}"
    return formatted_size if size_bytes >= 0 else f"-{formatted_size}"
```

This implementation handles both positive and negative file sizes and returns the formatted size as a string, even though negative sizes are not common in real-world scenarios.

[Tests]
You can write the following test cases to ensure it works correctly:

```python
test_data = [
    (1024 ** 2, "1.0MB"),
    (1024 ** 2 - 1, "1024.0KB"),
    (1024 ** 3 * 512, "512.0GB"),
    (1024 ** 4 * 512, "512.0TB"),
]
for size, expected_output in test_data:
    assert format_size(size) == expected_output
    assert format_size(-size) == f"-{expected_output}"
```

These test cases cover both positive and negative sizes across different units to validate the correctness of the `format_size` function.

### Example 8
[Code]
def unify_stringlist(L: list):
    """ Adds asterisks to strings that appear multiple times, so the resulting
    list has only unique strings but still the same length, order, and meaning.
    For example:
        unify_stringlist(['a','a','b','a','c']) -> ['a','a*','b','a**','c']
    """
    assert(all([isinstance(l,str) for l in L]))
    return [L[i]+"*"*L[:i].count(L[i]) for i in range(len(L))]
assert unify_stringlist(list("abc")) == list("abc")

[Instruction]
Design a Python function to encode a list of strings into a unique list with the same length, order, and meaning. The new list is formed by appending asterisks (*) to duplicate strings. For instance, given ['a', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'c'], the function should return ['a', 'a*', 'b', 'a**', 'c'], while for ['a', 'b', 'c'] it should return ['a', 'b', 'c'] without any changes. Make a precondition check through `assert` to ensure the input is a list of strings.

Solve the problem in two lines of code, one for the precondition check and the other for the main logic.

[Response]
[Reasoning]
You can achieve this functionality by first ensuring the input meets your requirements using an `assert` statement with list comprehension. Then, use another list comprehension to iterate through the input list and append `'*'` to the strings. The number of `'*'` is the number of occurrences of the string before the current index.

[Implementation]
Here's how you can do it in two lines of Python code:

```python
def encode_strings(input_list):
    assert all(isinstance(item, str) for item in input_list), "Input must be a list of strings"
    return [s + '*' * input_list[:i].count(s) for i, s in enumerate(input_list)]
```

[Explanation]
The `enumerate` function provides both the index and the string in each iteration, allowing you to count the occurrences of the string before the current index.

Note that although the function is concise, it is not the most efficient solution for large lists, as the `count` method has a time complexity of O(n) for each iteration. For larger lists, a more efficient approach might be to use a dictionary to store the counts of each string and then iterate through the list to append the appropriate number of `'*'` to each string.

[Tests]
Now you can test your function with the provided examples:

```python
assert encode_strings(['a', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'c']) == ['a', 'a*', 'b', 'a**', 'c']
assert encode_strings(['a', 'b', 'c']) == ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

### Example 9
[Code]
def _create_folds_list(data, count):
    """
    Creates folds from the given data.

    :param data: the data to fold
    :param count: the number of folds to create

    :return: a list of folds
    """

    fold_count = len(data) / count
    folds = list()

    for fold_index in range(count):
        low = int(fold_index * fold_count)
        high = int((fold_index + 1) * fold_count)

        fold = data[low:high]
        folds.append(fold)

    return folds

[Instruction]
Construct a Python function `create_folds(data, count)` to create a list of folds from the given data, where each fold is a subsequence of the original data. The length of each fold should be approximately equal with at most a difference of 1. The function should satisfy the following assertion:

```python
assert create_folds(range(12), 2) == [range(0, 6), range(6, 12)]
assert create_folds(range(8), 2) == [range(0, 4), range(4, 8)]
assert create_folds(range(25), -5) == []
assert create_folds(range(6), 2) == [range(0, 3), range(3, 6)]
```

[Response]
[Reasoning]
To create a Python function that generates a list of folds from given data with each fold having approximately equal length (with at most a difference of 1 between any two folds), you can follow these steps:

1. Return an empty list immediately if `count` is non-positive since it's not possible to create a valid number of folds.
2. Divide the total length of the data by `count`, rounding down, to get the minimum number of items each fold should have.
3. Calculate the remainder to see how many extra items need to be distributed among the folds. They are distributed one by one to the first `remainder` folds.
4. Use a loop to create each fold, adjusting the starting and ending indices based on the calculations above to ensure each fold has the correct number of items.

[Implementation]
Here's how you can implement this:

```python
def create_folds(data, count):
    # Return an empty list if count is non-positive
    if count <= 0:
        return []

    data_length = len(data)
    fold_size = data_length // count
    remainder = data_length % count

    folds = []
    start_index = 0

    for i in range(count):
        # Add 1 element to each of the first `remainder` folds
        end_index = start_index + fold_size + (1 if i < remainder else 0)
        folds.append(range(start_index, end_index))
        start_index = end_index

    return folds
```

[Explanation]
This implementation ensures that each fold has an equal length with at most a difference of 1 between any two folds. It handles edge cases, such as a non-positive `count`, by returning an empty list as specified.

[Tests]
You can test your code with the provided assertions to verify that the function works correctly:

```python
assert create_folds(range(12), 2) == [range(0, 6), range(6, 12)]
assert create_folds(range(8), 2) == [range(0, 4), range(4, 8)]
assert create_folds(range(25), -5) == []
assert create_folds(range(6), 2) == [range(0, 3), range(3, 6)]
```
